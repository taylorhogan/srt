i would like to be able to visualize a 3D model of deep sky objects.
In the directory https://github.com/taylorhogan/taylorhogan.github.io/tree/main/images you will find a collection of .jpg images.
Each image is of deep sky object. The name of the file is the name of the object.
write the html and three.js code to show the positions of these objects in the night sky, you will have to look up the r.a. and dec of each object

add in compass directions

update the code so that when a user double clicks on a label it shows a short (2-3 sentence ) explanation of the object

in addition to the explanation, show a larger view of the dso, that is the github repo

make the distance from the center of the celestial sphere a function of its distance from earth.

For all those objects in the milkyway put at the same distance, for all the objects outside the milkyway put on another bigger sphere

instead of spheres, put the object log distance from the earth
