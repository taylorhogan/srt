There is more to astrophotography than interesting pictures. It is a gateway to understanding why the structures
look like they do. I am mesmerized by this cluster and it's central galaxy NGC1275. I don't have the patience to 
spend much time in processing images. I would like to automate the entire process just to get something good enough.
My little patch of sky in New England is not a prime location, but it is what I have. After more than 45 hours of capture, 
and most of the month of October, I can begin to see the red filaments of the galaxy appearing. I believe I need more 
Hα subs for this to pop more.

- Description
The Perseus Cluster is  a rich galaxy cluster in the constellation Perseus, lies at a distance of approximately 
240 million light-years from Earth, making it one of the closest massive clusters and a prime target for multiwavelength
studies of gravitational dynamics and intracluster medium (ICM) physics. Comprising over a thousand galaxies bound by 
dark matter and pervasive hot gas emitting copiously in X-rays, the cluster spans about 8 million light-years in 
diameter, with its core region—roughly 0.8 million light-years across—hosting the bulk of the action. Central to this 
is NGC 1275, a massive elliptical galaxy classified as a Seyfert 1.5 active galactic nucleus (AGN), powered by a 
supermassive black hole of ~8 × 10^8 solar masses. 

What really catches the eye in NGC 1275 are its glowing red filaments—like thin, crimson threads of cool gas lit up 
by hydrogen atoms (glowing in H-alpha). These strands stretch up to 65,000 light-years long but are super
skinny, only about 200 light-years wide, and each one holds the mass of a million Suns. 
Pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope show them as straight, arrow-like lines poking out from the galaxy, 
giving us clues about how hot and cool gases mix in space. Similar wispy features pop up in other clusters like Virgo,
helping explain why big galaxies eventually stop making new stars.
